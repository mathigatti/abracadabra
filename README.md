# abracadabra
Make your computer execute whatever you want after you say "abracadabra".

## How it works?

This is a basic keyword detection program trained using [teachable machine techonology](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/). If your voice is different from [mine](https://github.com/mathigatti/abracadabra/blob/main/data/1.wav) it might not work so well, and it might be better if you go to the teachable machine website and train a new model with your own voice (it takes just a few minutes), then you just need to publish the model and update [this line](https://github.com/mathigatti/abracadabra/blob/main/templates/index.html#L12).

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Some python packages (To install them try running `pip install -r requeriments.txt`)

## Running it

```
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080
```

Once it's running you should be able to access [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and see the website, after you press the START button it should start working.

Right now it just prints "abracadabra" in the terminal, but you can change that to whatever you want [here](https://github.com/mathigatti/abracadabra/blob/main/app.py#L9).
